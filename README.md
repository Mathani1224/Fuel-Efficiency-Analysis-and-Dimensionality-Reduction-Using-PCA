The Fuel Efficiency Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA project focuses on predicting a vehicleâ€™s miles per gallon (MPG) while simplifying complex data. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), it reduces dimensionality and highlights key features affecting fuel efficiency. This improves model performance and provides clearer insights into the factors that influence vehicle mileage.
